# Hotel Project
A program that will automatically store and analyze the price of hotel rooms of five hotel franchises of your choice in five cities of choice through testing. 
It will then find the ten dates with the lowest price for a room in each of the hotels from each of the cities. It will gather the data of 1-night stays from May 1st until December 31st.
